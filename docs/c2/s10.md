    1. Give the Big O performance of the following code fragment:

        ```python
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                k = 2 + 2
        ```

    2. Give the Big O performance of the following code fragment:

        ```python
            for i in range(n):
                    k = 2 + 2
        ```

    3. Give the Big O performance of the following code fragment:

        ```python
            i = n
            while i > 0:
                k = 2 + 2
                i = i // 2
        ```

    4. Give the Big O performance of the following code fragment:

        ```python
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    for k in range(n):
                        k = 2 + 2
        ```

    5. Give the Big O performance of the following code fragment:

        ```python
            for i in range(n):
                k = 2 + 2
            for j in range(n):
                k = 2 + 2
            for k in range(n):
                k = 2 + 2
        ```

    6. Devise an experiment to verify that the ``list index`` operator is $O(1)$.

    7. Devise an experiment to verify that ``get item`` and ``set item`` are $O(1)$ for dictionaries.

    8. Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the ``del`` operator on lists and dictionaries.

    9. Given a list of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that works in $O(n\log(n))$ to find the $k$ th smallest number in the list.

    10. Can you improve the algorithm from the previous problem to be linear? Explain.
