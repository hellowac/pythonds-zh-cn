    The goals for this chapter are as follows:
    
    -  To understand that complex problems that may otherwise be difficult to solve may have a simple recursive solution.
    -  To learn how to formulate programs recursively.
    -  To understand and apply the three laws of recursion.
    -  To understand recursion as a form of iteration.
    -  To implement the recursive formulation of a problem.
    -  To understand how recursion is implemented by a computer system.
