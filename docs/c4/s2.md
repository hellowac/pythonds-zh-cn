# 4.2. 什么是递归？

**4.2. What Is Recursion?**

=== "中文"

    **递归** 是一种解决问题的方法，涉及将问题拆解成越来越小的子问题，直到得到一个足够小的问题，以便可以简单地解决。通常，递归涉及一个函数调用自身。尽管表面上看起来并不复杂，但递归使我们能够为可能非常难以编程的问题编写优雅的解决方案。


=== "英文"
    
    **Recursion** is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems that may otherwise be very difficult to program.
