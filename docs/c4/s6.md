# 4.6. 栈帧：实现递归

**4.6. Stack Frames: Implementing Recursion**

=== "中文"

    Suppose that instead of concatenating the result of the recursive call to ``to_str`` with the string from ``convert_string``, we modified our algorithm to push the strings onto a stack instead of making the recursive call. The code for this modified algorithm is shown in `ActiveCode 4.6.1`.
    
    ```python title="Activity: 4.6.1 Converting an Integer to a String Using a Stack" linenums="1"
    
    from pythonds3.basic import Stack
    
    
    def to_str(n, base):
        r_stack = Stack()
        convert_string = "0123456789ABCDEF"
        while n > 0:
            if n < base:
                r_stack.push(convert_string[n])
            else:
                r_stack.push(convert_string[n % base])
            n = n // base
        res = ""
        while not r_stack.is_empty():
            res = res + str(r_stack.pop())
        return res
    
    
    print(to_str(1453, 16))
    ```
    
    Each time we make a call to ``to_str``, we push a character on the stack. Returning to the previous example we can see that after the fourth call to ``to_str`` the stack would look like `Figure 4.5`. Notice that now we can simply pop the characters off the stack and concatenate them into the final result, ``"1010"``.

    The previous example gives us some insight into how Python implements a recursive function call. When a function is called in Python, a **stack frame** is allocated to handle the local variables of the function. When the function returns, the return value is left on top of the stack for the calling function to access. `Figure 4.6` illustrates the call stack after the return statement on line 4.

    </figure>
    
    Notice that the call to ``to_str(2 // 2, 2)`` defined in Listing 4.4 leaves a return value of ``"1"`` on the stack. This return value is then used in place of the function call (``to_str(1, 2)``) in the expression ``"1" + convert_string[2 % 2]``, which will leave the string ``"10"`` on the top of the stack. In this way, the Python call stack takes the place of the stack we used explicitly in `ActiveCode 4.6.1`. In our list summing example, you can think of the return value on the stack taking the place of an accumulator variable.
    
    The stack frames also provide a scope for the variables used by the function. Even though we are calling the same function over and over, each call creates a new scope for the variables that are local to the function.
