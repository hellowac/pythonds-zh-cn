# 5.13. 总结

**5.13. Summary**

=== "中文"

    -  A sequential search is $O(n)$ for ordered and unordered lists.
    -  A binary search of an ordered list is $O(\log{n})$ in the worst case.
    -  Hash tables can provide constant time searching.
    -  A bubble sort, a selection sort, and an insertion sort are $O(n^{2})$ algorithms.
    -  A Shell sort improves on the insertion sort by sorting incremental sublists. It falls between $O(n)$ and $O(n^{2})$.
    -  A merge sort is $O(n \log{n})$, but requires additional space for the merging process.
    -  A quicksort is $O(n \log{n})$, but may degrade to $O(n^{2})$ if the split points are not near the middle of the list. It does not require additional space.
