**6.10. Binary Heap Operations**

=== "中文"

    The basic operations we will implement for our binary heap are as follows:
    
    -  ``BinaryHeap()`` creates a new empty binary heap.
    -  ``insert(k)`` adds a new item to the heap.
    -  ``get_min()`` returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving the item in the heap.
    -  ``delete()`` returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the item from the heap.
    -  ``is_empty()`` returns ``True`` if the heap is empty, ``False`` otherwise.
    -  ``size()`` returns the number of items in the heap.
    -  ``heapify(list)`` builds a new heap from a list of keys.
    
    `ActiveCode 1` demonstrates the use of some of the binary heap methods.  Notice that no matter what order we add items to the heap, the smallest is removed each time.
    
    ```python title="Activity: 6.10.1 Using the Binary Heap"
    from pythonds3.trees import BinaryHeap
    
    my_heap = BinaryHeap()
    my_heap.insert(5)
    my_heap.insert(7)
    my_heap.insert(3)
    my_heap.insert(11)
    
    print(my_heap.delete())
    print(my_heap.delete())
    print(my_heap.delete())
    print(my_heap.delete())
    ```
