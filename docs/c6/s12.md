**6.12. Binary Search Trees**

=== "中文"
    
    We have already seen two different ways to get key-value pairs in a collection. Recall that these collections implement the **map** abstract data type. The two implementations of the map ADT that we have discussed were binary search on a list and hash tables. In this section we will study **binary search trees** as yet another way to map from a key to a value. In this case we are not interested in the exact placement of items in the tree, but we are interested in using the binary tree structure to provide for efficient searching.
