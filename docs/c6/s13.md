    Before we look at the implementation, let’s review the interface provided by the map ADT. You will notice that this interface is very similar to the Python dictionary.
    
    -  ``Map()`` creates a new empty map.
    -  ``put(key, val)`` adds a new key--value pair to the map. If the key is already in the map, it replaces the old value with the new value.
    -  ``get(key)`` takes a key and returns the matching value stored in the map or ``None`` otherwise.
    -  ``del`` deletes the key--value pair from the map using a statement of the form ``del map[key]``.
    -  ``size()`` returns the number of key--value pairs stored in the map.
    -  ``in`` return ``True`` for a statement of the form ``key in map`` if the given key is in the map, ``False`` otherwise.
