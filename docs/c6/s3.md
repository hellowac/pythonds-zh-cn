**6.3. Vocabulary and Definitions**

=== "中文"

    Now that we have looked at examples of trees, we will formally define a tree and its components.
    
    Node
       : A **node** is a fundamental part of a tree. It can have a name, which we call the *key*. A node may also have additional information. We call this additional information the *value* or *payload*. While the payload information is not central to many tree algorithms, it is often critical in applications that make use of trees.
    
    Edge
       : An **edge** is another fundamental part of a tree. An edge connects two
        nodes to show that there is a relationship between them. Every node
        (except the root) is connected by exactly one incoming edge from
        another node. Each node may have several outgoing edges.
    
    Root
       : The **root** of the tree is the only node in the tree that has no
        incoming edges. In `Figure 2`, / is the root of the tree.
    
    Path
       : A **path** is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges, for
        example,
        Mammalia $\rightarrow$ Carnivora $\rightarrow$ Felidae $\rightarrow$ *Felis* $\rightarrow$ *catus*
        is a path.
    
    Children
       : The set of nodes that have incoming edges from the same
        node are said to be the **children** of that node. In `Figure 2`,
        nodes log/, spool/, and yp/ are the children of node var/.
    
    Parent
       : A node is the **parent** of all the nodes it connects to with outgoing edges. In `Figure 2` the node var/ is the parent of nodes log/, spool/, and yp/.
    
    Sibling
       : Nodes in the tree that are children of the same parent are said to be **siblings**. The nodes etc/ and usr/ are siblings in the file system tree shown in `Figure 2`.
    
    Subtree
       : A **subtree** is a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and allthe descendants of that parent.
    
    Leaf Node
       : 
        A **leaf node** is a node that has no children. For example, Human and
        Chimpanzee are leaf nodes in `Figure 1`.
    
    Level
       : The **level** of a node $n$ is the number of edges on the path from the root node to $n$. For example, the level of the Felis node in `Figure 1` is five. By definition, the level of the root node is zero.
    
    Height
       : The **height** of a tree is equal to the maximum level of any node in the tree. The height of the tree in `Figure 2` is two.
    
    With the basic vocabulary now defined, we can move on to a formal definition of a tree. In fact, we will provide two definitions of a tree. One definition involves nodes and edges. The second definition, which will prove to be very useful, is a recursive definition.
    
    *Definition One:* A tree consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect pairs of nodes. A tree has the following properties:
    
    -  One node of the tree is designated as the root node.
    -  Every node $n$, except the root node, is connected by an edge from exactly one other node $p$, where $p$ is the parent of $n$.
    -  A unique path traverses from the root to each node.
    -  If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that the tree is a **binary tree**.
    
    `Figure 3` illustrates a tree that fits definition one. The arrowheads on the edges indicate the direction of the connection.

    </figure>
    
    *Definition Two:* A tree is either empty or consists of a root and zero or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree. The root of each subtree is connected to the root of the parent tree by an edge. `Figure 4` illustrates this recursive definition of a tree. Using the recursive definition of a tree, we know that the tree in `Figure 4` has at least four nodes since each of the triangles representing a subtree must have a root. It may have many more nodes than that, but we do not know unless we look deeper into the tree.
