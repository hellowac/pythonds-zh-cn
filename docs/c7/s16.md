**7.16. Depth-First Search Analysis**

=== "中文"


    The general running time for depth-first search is as follows. The loops in ``dfs`` both run in $O(|V|)$, not counting what happens in ``dfs_visit``, since they are executed once for each vertex in the graph. In ``dfs_visit`` the loop is executed once for each edge in the adjacency list of the current vertex. Since ``dfs_visit`` is only called recursively if the vertex is white, the loop will execute a maximum of once for every edge in the graph, or $O(|E|)$. Therefore, the total time for depth-first search is $O(|V| + |E|)$.
