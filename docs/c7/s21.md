**7.21. Analysis of Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

=== "中文"

    Finally, let’s look at the running time of Dijkstra’s algorithm. We first note that building the priority queue takes $O(|V|)$ time since we initially add every vertex in the graph to the priority queue. Once the queue is constructed, the ``while`` loop  is executed once for every vertex since vertices are all added at the beginning and only removed after that. Within that loop each call to ``delete`` takes $O(\log{|V|})$ time. Taken together, that part of the loop and the calls to ``delete`` take $O(|V| \times \log{|V|})$. The ``for`` loop is executed once for each edge in the graph, and within the ``for`` loop the call to ``change_priority`` takes $O(|E| \times \log{|V|})$ time. So the combined running time is $O((|V|+|E|) \times \log{|V|})$.
