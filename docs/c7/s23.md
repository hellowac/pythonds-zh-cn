# 7.23. 总结

**7.23. Summary**

=== "中文"

    In this chapter we have looked at the graph abstract data type and some implementations of a graph. A graph enables us to solve many problems— provided we can transform the original problem into something that can be represented by a graph. In particular, we have seen that graphs are useful to solve problems in the following general areas:
    
    - Breadth-first search for finding the unweighted shortest path.
    - Dijkstra’s algorithm for the weighted shortest path.
    - Depth-first search for graph exploration.
    - Strongly connected components for simplifying a graph.
    - Topological sort for ordering tasks.
    - Minimum weight spanning trees for broadcasting messages.
